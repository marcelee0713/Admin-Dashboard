# Admin-Dashboard
A Project on TOP.

Hello! I will not be that active that much on using Javascript or any web related. Because I'm currently on a University where I have to do a project that people can use. And the programming language I'll be using is **Java** , the markup language is **XML**, and finally **Firebase**. Which is a lot and especially the learning curve of **Java**.

But I might still use **JavaScript** for at least 2 hours per day.

Anyways thank you for reading.
